## Course Mantras

Here are some philosophies that will get you far in data analytic work. We will be revisiting these over and over again. 

- Embrace plain text.
- Source is real. Think in terms of source and output. 
- Your analysis should be reproducible. Document, test, and leave a breadcrumb trail (version control), even when you are the only collaborator. 

## Conversation, and Getting Help

Are you stuck? First, try to get unstuck by yourself by following [this general help advice](help-general.html).

While you are getting started, we recommend you seek help within the STAT545 community first, before, e.g. posting to external forums. We are more cuddly.

The instructor and TAs stand ready to assist you, but your peers will also be a great source of good questions and answers. For that reason, we encourage you to seek help in ways that are visible to others. 

The options are sort of listed in order of preference. But we realize every situation is different and your comfort level with these approaches will change as you learn more.

1. Want to talk about content/coding issues? Post an Issue in the [Discussion](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion) (public) repository.
2. Want to talk about the course? Post an Issue in the [Discussion-Internal](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion-Internal) (private) repository.
3. Want to talk in person? Come visit us during office hours!
4. Want to privately contact Vincenzo? Feel free to send me an email.
    - I look forward to receiving your email, though I do encourage you to post in one of the `Discussion` repositories unless it's really not appropriate for either platform. 


### Basic Issue workflow

Some advice on opening an Issue on GitHub:

* Give it a specific title.
  - BAD: "aaaaaarrrrrrgh!", "things not working", "i need help"
  - GOOD: 'error when indexing a matrix: "incorrect number of dimensions"'
* Stay specific and be complete-but-concise in the body of the description. Don't expect your helper to play 20 questions with you.
* (Optional) Tag someone: 
	- To get the attention of the teaching team, add the `@2018_teaching_team` tag to notify all five of us.
* Don't just create Issues -- also respond to them! Think about this in terms of adding to the conversation, not in terms of "correctness". 
* Don't forget to click "Submit new issue"!

Typically, this will trigger an email to the person/team you tagged. The title of your issue will be in the subject line, so I repeat, *make it specific*. Your description will become the body of the email. At the bottom will be a link to the issue on GitHub.

If all goes well, your helper will respond. I almost always do this directly via GitHub, though simply replying to the email basically works. In any case, this back-and-forth will show up as a series of comments on your original issue. It's like an email dialogue but better:

* It's embedded in a relevant Organization/project/repo, so it will be easier to find later vs. digging out of your giant vat of unfiled email.
* It's potentially visible to others (depending on the repo), which could save us from asking/answering the same questions repeatedly.
* The whole discussion will be mirrored via email, so that still serves as a great way to prompt participants to tune in.
* Later you can get fancy and refer to commits and other issues within the repo in slick ways.
  
Once the problem is resolved, the issue can be closed. Note that closed issues remain accessible, in case anyone needs to consult them in the future.

## Annotated Resources

Here are the resources we will be referring to throughout the course, along with a brief description of the resource. 

Overarching resources:

1. <http://stat545.com>
    - As mentioned earlier, this website can be thought of as a textbook for STAT 545/547.

    - Great for marrying git, GitHub, R, and RStudio in your workflow.
