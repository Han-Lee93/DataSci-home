Interested in taking Data Science and Programming, and have questions? Read on!

### When is the course offered?

Currently, the course is offered as a special topics course. The plan is to offer 
the courese in Spring every other year.    

### Can I sit in on the course without registering?

Unfortunately not, because the room is generally at capacity. 

### Should I register in ...?

This course is open first to undergraduate students at USF. Graduate students may register 
depending on space availability and teaching resources. Students from any department may register;
please contact me if you have difficulty registering. 

This course involves intensive programming and scripting. This will be a powerful, 
positive experience, but it's a big adjustment if you've never coded before. 
Come suffer through the worst part of the learning curve in good company!

### Do I need a computer?

YES. You absolutely must have access to a computer on which you can install 
software, download data, etc. In fact, *class meetings* will be a mix of lecture, 
discussion, and live coding. You may use either the lab desktop computers or a 
laptop. I recommend working with a laptop if you have one available.

### Prerequisites

There are no official pre-requisites for the class, but most students will have 
had at least one prior statistics course or comparable experience.
