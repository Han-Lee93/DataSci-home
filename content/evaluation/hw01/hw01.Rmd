## Objective

This assignment was designed to give you practice with the tools discussed in the first two weeks: GitHub, R, (R) Markdown, and git. You'll be:

- Developing of a simple repository with GitHub; perhaps git too
- Authoring in GitHub-flavoured markdown and R markdown
- Coding in R through data exploration
- Generating output from (`.Rmd`) source using RStudio.

As you work on the assignment, you are welcome to work from the browser (i.e., directly on GitHub), but I encourage you to pilot a more powerful workflow:

- Pull from GitHub (just an empty precaution now, but will matter when you collaborate with others).
- Make changes locally to local files -- RStudio is a great Markdown editor! Click Preview to see how it's going to look!
- Save your changes.
- Commit your changes to your repo.
- Push the commit to GitHub.

## Tidy Submission (20%)

Follow the instructions for making a tidy submission, found on the [assignments home page](https://wiernik-datasci.netlify.com/evaluation/assignments).

Note: Usually, a tidy submission does not have this much weight, but I know that this part is not trivial for your first time. A tidy submission involves using the tools taught in Week 1, and this is what this assignment is all about.

## Writing (5%)

- You must use clear English writing, spelling, and grammar.
- Your writing is concise. 

## Exercise 1: Edit `README.md` (30%)

---

Rubrics: 

- Accuracy: (10%)
	- Does your markdown render properly, or are there mistakes like _this__ or (this)[www.example.com]?
- completeness: (20%)
	- Did you include at least five markdown features in your README? (= 4% each)

---

Your task here is to edit the main `README.md` file in your repository. It should contain the following:

1. The beginning of the README should contain a very brief description as to what the repository is (a sentence or two), so that an unknowing visitor landing on the repository can orient themselves. You should also help the visitor navigate your repository (in whatever way you think is most appropriate). 
2. Then, introduce yourself briefly. 

When writing your README, be sure to showcase at least five functionalities of GitHub-flavored markdown. The [markdown cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) might help here, or, the *Help* menu in RStudio will bring up a Markdown Quick Reference at any time.

Here's a [sample readme file](https://github.com/USF-Psych-DataSci/DataSci-home/blob/master/content/evaluation/hw01/sample_readme.md) that goes way above and beyond what I'm looking for (aside from describing the repo).

## Exercise 2: RMarkdown for Dataset exploration (30%)

---

Rubrics:

- Accuracy: (20%)
	- Did you use at least three functions?
	- Given that you did, does your code run error-free?
- Reasoning: (10%)
	- Does your exploration showcase the dataset?

---

Make an R Markdown document that explores a dataset, such as `gapminder` or 
`psych::bfi` seen in class. You don't need an extensive exploration in order to 
get a good grade here. You just need enough to show someone reading your report
some of the features of the dataset beyond just printing it to screen. 

For example, what is the general structure of the dataset? How many rows does it
have? How many colums? What are the descriptive statistics for some of the
important variables?

You should demonstrate the use of at least three functions.

Don't forget! Your "tidy submission" marks relies on you rendering your 
RMarkdown file to the `github_document` output format. Commit both the `.Rmd` 
and `.md` files and push them to GitHub. 

Give this a decent name, such as `hw01_gapminder.Rmd` (which will produce a 
companion file, `hw01_gapminder.md`). These files should also be in a folder 
called something like `hw01`.

## Exercise 3: R Markdown presentation slides (15%)

---

Rubrics:

- Accuracy: (5%)
	- Did you manage to produce slides at all?
- Reasoning: (10%)
	- Is your slide deck formatted so that it actually looks like it could be a 
	  presentation? I _am not referring to_ whether your slides would make an 
	  _effective_ presentation (by, for example, minimizing your text and keeping 
	  your slides simple). By "formatted", I mean things like:
		  - Slides do not have text overflowing its boundaries
		  - Sentences are not cut in half by a new slide.
		  - At least some slides have titles.

---

Produce slides out of your data exploration using R Markdown -- for example, 
using the `ioslides` or `xaringan` output. Don't worry, you won't be presenting 
these -- the objective of this exercise is to see that you can make slides. 
Feel free to make a new `.Rmd` file for this.
