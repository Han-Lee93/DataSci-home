title: "Participation Assessment"
date: "Updated `r Sys.Date()`"
---


__Due__: Wednesday, April 29, at 23:59.

At the end of the semester, you will submit a personal GitHub repository 
containing all of your in-class work for review and grading. The intent of the 
participation assessment is to encourage following along with class activities,
which are usually coding sessions. 


## Expectations

In short, I'm evaluating _completeness_, not _correctness_. 

Specifically, your participation component will be evaluated by the completeness 
of your repository. You'll be prompted in class when you should be contributing 
to your participation repository. 

A checklist for your participation repo is [here](/evaluation/participation_checklist.md).
This checklist will be updated each week of the semester to indicate what should
be included in your participation repo from that week.


### Completeness (60%)

Your repository should be _complete_ with all in-class exercises. Your work 
should resemble an honest _attempt_ at the activities, but **does not** need to 
be anywhere near "correct"â€”even completely failing at an activity will earn you 
full marks here!

Each of the 12 classes will receive equal weight here (5% per class).

### Documentation (40%)

Your repository should be _well-documented_. 

- 10%: Does your main `README` orient a stranger to your repository?
- 10%: Will a stranger be able to figure out what the main files of your 
  repository are for, and where they are located?
- 10%: Are the contents of your files human readable? I'm not expecting 
  publication-quality prose, but there should be a moderate level of readability 
  of your scripts to earn you full points here.
- 10%: Does your repository follow good coding style and layout?


### Missing class

If you miss class, you can still do the activities another time. They only need
to be completed by the end of the semester (though doing them in class will
give you an opportunity for live and easy feedback from me or your peers).


## Setup

Here are the instructions to set up your participation repository.

1. On your GitHub user account, make a new repository:
    - Click the "+" in the top-right corner -> "New repository"
    - Call it `DataSci-participation`
    - I highly recommend making this a _public_ repo. But if you so desire, 
      make it private. You can change this later.
    - Say YES to initializing with a `README`.
    - For the `.gitignore` option, select `R` from the dropdown menu.
    
2. Add me as a collaborator:
	- Click on "Settings" -> "Collaborators".
	- Add `bwiernik`
	
3. Submit a link to your participation repo to 
   [Canvas](https://usflearn.instructure.com/courses/1481210). Do this right
   away at the beginning of the semester.
   - Don't worry, I won't grade it (or look at it) until after the deadline. 


## Submitting your participation repository

If you've completed Step 3 in the above "Setup" section, you don't have to do 
anything at the end of the semester to submit your repo. I will grade your repo
as it was on the last commit before the deadline.
