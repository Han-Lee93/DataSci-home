<p>As part of this course you will be reviewing and commenting on other students’
assignments. This is a mandatory part of the course and you will be graded on
your peer reviews.</p>
<p>Here is a template for giving a peer review: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USF-Psych-DataSci/DataSci-home/master/content/evaluation/peer-review-template.md">markdown version</a>
or <a href="/evaluation/peer-review-template">formatted version</a>.</p>

<h2>Peer code review process</h2>
<p>When a new assignment is posted, a GitHub Issue will be posted in the
<a href="https://github.com/USF-Psych-DataSci-2020/Announcements">Announcements</a>
repo. This Issue will also include a link to the peer review assignments for
that assignment.</p>
<p>The linked page will show a table listing two classmates whose code you should
review. Navigate to your classmates’ homework assignment pull requests and look
them over. Make comments, either inline, at the bottom of the pull request page,
or both. To let your classmates know you have finished your review, be sure to
click the “Complete Review” button and also write a comment tagging them.</p>
<p>After you have completed your review, submit links to the two reviews you left
in the designated area on <a href="https://usflearn.instructure.com/courses/1481210">Canvas</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="expectations" class="section level2">
<h2>Expectations</h2>
<p>Your reviews should contain thoughtful, constructive, and considerate comments.
They should be specific and concise, and they should address the specific code
and style of the submission you are reviewing.</p>
<p>You will receive poor grades for your reviews if they are so generic that it’s
hard to determine which assignment your reviewing.</p>
<p>You will receive an F if your review is mean or disrespectful.</p>
</div>
<div id="resources" class="section level2">
<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>How to give a good peer review:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give thoughtful, constructive and considerate comments.</li>
<li>Be specific and concise.</li>
<li>Follow the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USF-Psych-DataSci/DataSci-home/master/content/evaluation/peer-review-template.md">review template</a>
as a guide for the types of things you should comment on.</li>
<li>Try to learn something new and, if you succeed, point that out.</li>
<li>If you can’t find anything to praise or that you found helpful, then at least offer some suggestions in a kind way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Peer reviewing and critiquing others’ work (especially their code) is a useful
skill to develop during your studies. Although these links deal mainly with peer
review of academic papers, most of the key points are applicable to our peer
code review process.</p>
