title: "Data Science and Programming Assignment 02: Explore gapminder and use dplyr"
---

__Due February 10, 2020 at 23:59__

## Objective

The goal is to get your feet wet with `ggplot2` and `dplyr` to explore a dataset.

## Setup

Work with the `gapminder` data we explored in class, or more than one data set if you want.

The gapminder data is distributed as an R package from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gapminder/index.html). 
Install it if you have not done so already, by executing the code 
`install.packages("gapminder")`, and remember to load it with `library(gapminder)`.

Install and load `dplyr`, probably via the `tidyverse` meta-package.

## Tidy Submission (10%)

#### Mechanics (5%)

Follow the instructions for making a tidy submission, found on the [assignments home page](/evaluation/assignments).

#### Writing (5%)

- You must use clear English writing, spelling, and grammar.
- Your writing is concise. 

## Exercise 1: Basic `dplyr` (45%)

Use `dplyr` functions to achieve the following.

### 1.1 (9%)

---

Rubrics:

- Accuracy
	- How successful were you at producing the required tibble?
	
---

Use `filter()` to subset the `gapminder` data to three countries of your choice in the 1970's.

### 1.2 (9%)

---

Rubrics:

- Accuracy
	- How successful were you at producing the required tibble?
	
---

Use the pipe operator `%>%` to select "country" and "gdpPercap" from your filtered dataset in 1.1.

### 1.3 (9%)

---

Rubrics:

- Accuracy
	- How successful were you at producing the required tibble?
	
---

Filter `gapminder` to all entries that have experienced a drop in life 
expectancy. Be sure to include a new variable that's the increase in life 
expectancy in your tibble. 

__Hint__: you might find the `lag()` or `diff()` functions useful. 

### 1.4 (9%)

---

Rubrics:

- Accuracy
	- How successful were you at producing the required tibble?
	
---

Choose **one** of the following: 

- Filter `gapminder` so that it shows the max GDP per capita experienced by 
each country. __Hint__: you might find the `max()` function useful here. 

OR

- Filter gapminder to contain six rows: the rows with the three largest GDP per 
  capita, and the rows with the three smallest GDP per capita. Be sure to not 
  create any intermediate objects when doing this (with, for example, the 
  assignment operator). 
  
  __Hint__: you might find the `sort()` function useful, or perhaps even the 
  `dplyr::slice()` function.


### 1.5 (9%)

---

Rubrics:

- Accuracy
	- How successful were you at producing the required plot?

---

Produce a scatterplot of Canada's life expectancy vs. GDP per capita using 
`ggplot2`, without defining a new variable. That is, after filtering the 
`gapminder` data set, pipe it directly into the `ggplot()` function. Ensure GDP 
per capita is on a log scale. 


## Exercise 2: Explore individual variables with `dplyr` (15%)

---

Rubrics: 

- Reasoning: (8%)
	- Does your exploration make sense?
- Accuracy: (7%)
	- Does your code work?

---

Pick one categorical variable and one quantitative variable to explore. Answer 
the following questions in whichever way you think is appropriate, using `dplyr`:

* What are the possible values (or range, whichever is appropriate) of each variable?
* What values are typical? What's the spread? What's the distribution? Etc., tailored to the variable at hand.
* Feel free to use summary stats, tables, figures.


## Exercise 3: Explore various plot types (30%)

---

Rubrics: 

- Reasoning: (15%)
	- Were you able to produce plots that make sense?
	- We're not looking for publication quality graphics here yet.
- Accuracy: (15%)
	- Does your code work?

---

Make two plots that have some value to them. That is, plots that someone might 
actually consider making for an analysis. Just don't make the same plots we made 
in classâ€”feel free to use a data set from the `datasets` R package or any other
source if you wish.

1. A scatterplot of two quantitative variables.
2. One other plot besides a scatterplot.

You don't have to use all the data in every plot! It's fine to filter down to 
one group or country or a small handful of groups/countries.


## Recycling (Optional) (extra 2%)

---

Rubrics: 

- Reasoning
	- How well did you reason through the scenario?

---

*For people who want to take things further.*

Evaluate this code and describe the result. Presumably the analyst's intent was 
to get the data for Rwanda and Afghanistan. Did they succeed? Why or why not? 
If not, what is the correct way to do this?

```
filter(gapminder, country == c("Rwanda", "Afghanistan"))
```

## Tibble display (Optional) (extra 1%)

---

Rubrics: 

- Accuracy
	- Do your tibbles in this assignment adopt the required convention?

---

Present numerical tables in a more attractive form using `knitr::kable()` for 
small tibbles (say, up to 10 rows), and `DT::datatable()` for larger tibbles.
