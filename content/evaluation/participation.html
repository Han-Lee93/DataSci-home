title: "Participation Assessment"
date: "Updated 2020-01-14"
---



<p><strong>Due</strong>: Wednesday, April 29, at 23:59.</p>
<p>At the end of the semester, you will submit a personal GitHub repository
containing all of your in-class work for review and grading. The intent of the
participation assessment is to encourage following along with class activities,
which are usually coding sessions.</p>
<div id="expectations" class="section level2">
<h2>Expectations</h2>
<p>In short, I’m evaluating <em>completeness</em>, not <em>correctness</em>.</p>
<p>Specifically, your participation component will be evaluated by the completeness
of your repository. You’ll be prompted in class when you should be contributing
to your participation repository.</p>
<p>A checklist for your participation repo is <a href="/evaluation/participation_checklist.md">here</a>.
This checklist will be updated each week of the semester to indicate what should
be included in your participation repo from that week.</p>
<div id="completeness-60" class="section level3">
<h3>Completeness (60%)</h3>
<p>Your repository should be <em>complete</em> with all in-class exercises. Your work
should resemble an honest <em>attempt</em> at the activities, but <strong>does not</strong> need to
be anywhere near “correct”—even completely failing at an activity will earn you
full marks here!</p>
<p>Each of the 12 classes will receive equal weight here (5% per class).</p>
</div>
<div id="documentation-40" class="section level3">
<h3>Documentation (40%)</h3>
<p>Your repository should be <em>well-documented</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>10%: Does your main <code>README</code> orient a stranger to your repository?</li>
<li>10%: Will a stranger be able to figure out what the main files of your
repository are for, and where they are located?</li>
<li>10%: Are the contents of your files human readable? I’m not expecting
publication-quality prose, but there should be a moderate level of readability
of your scripts to earn you full points here.</li>
<li>10%: Does your repository follow good coding style and layout?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="missing-class" class="section level3">
<h3>Missing class</h3>
<p>If you miss class, you can still do the activities another time. They only need
to be completed by the end of the semester (though doing them in class will
give you an opportunity for live and easy feedback from me or your peers).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="setup" class="section level2">
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Here are the instructions to set up your participation repository.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>On your GitHub user account, make a new repository:
<ul>
<li>Click the “+” in the top-right corner -&gt; “New repository”</li>
<li>Call it <code>DataSci-participation</code></li>
<li>I highly recommend making this a <em>public</em> repo. But if you so desire,
make it private. You can change this later.</li>
<li>Say YES to initializing with a <code>README</code>.</li>
<li>For the <code>.gitignore</code> option, select <code>R</code> from the dropdown menu.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Add me as a collaborator:
<ul>
<li>Click on “Settings” -&gt; “Collaborators”.</li>
<li>Add <code>bwiernik</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Submit a link to your participation repo to
<a href="https://usflearn.instructure.com/courses/1481210">Canvas</a>. Do this right
away at the beginning of the semester.
<ul>
<li>Don’t worry, I won’t grade it (or look at it) until after the deadline.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="submitting-your-participation-repository" class="section level2">
<h2>Submitting your participation repository</h2>
<p>If you’ve completed Step 3 in the above “Setup” section, you don’t have to do
anything at the end of the semester to submit your repo. I will grade your repo
as it was on the last commit before the deadline.</p>
</div>
