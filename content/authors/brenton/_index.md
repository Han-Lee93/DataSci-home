I am an assistant professor of industrial–organizational psychology at the University of South Florida. My research focuses on understanding individual differences characteristics, such as personality traits, cognitive abilities, interests, and values, and their impact on work and life outcomes. I also develop new quantitative and meta-analytic research methods and study how employee work behaviors can contribute to environmental sustainability.

I am a developer of the **psychmeta** package for conducting psychometric meta-analyses in R, available from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=psychmeta) and [GitHub](https://github.com/psychmeta/psychmeta).
