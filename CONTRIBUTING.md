## General Rule

As a general rule, please submit changes as a pull request. If you'd like to make a change that isn't small, it would be wise to contact the instructor of the course (probably `@bwiernik`) to pass the idea by them.

## Teaching Assistants

TA's for the course should feel free to commit to `master` when it comes to things like updating assignments and peer review information. Otherwise, please adopt the "General Rule".
